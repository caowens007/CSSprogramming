          <p> Teaching multiple sections for three different computer science classes. The first class, Advanced Programming, is where students learn to program in Java using the Greenfoot programming platform.  Lessons are designed to nurture and enhance logical and critical thinking skills varying between learning programming constructs, and writing code in a GUI environment.  The second class is AP Computer Science A where students are challenged to further their knowledge of the Java programming language and prepare them for the AP exam.  Technology and utilization of internet resources is interwoven throughout the curriculum.  Students access on-line coding tools to practice
            and enhance their coding skills as well as to reinforce content.  AP style multiple choice questions as well as Free Response Problems are presented on a regular basis to assess student knowledge and give students the necessary exposure to the types of questions they will encounter on the exam.  The third class is AP Computer Science Principles.  This class introduces students to a variety of topics in the field of computer science.  Students learn primarily by discovery through teamwork and collaboration using the Harvard CS50 curriculum with lessons interwoven from Code.org. </p>

            <h5 class="black-header"> Mathematics/Computer Science Teacher</h5>
            <p> Taught 2 mathematics sections, which included Algebra II and Computer Math, a program tailored to enhance student knowledge and mastery of Algebra and Geometry concepts in preparation for college algebra.  Skilled in designing and developing engaging unit-based projects based on real-world scenarios to demonstrate the connection between mathematics and everyday life.  Creative lesson plans incorporate scaffolding and provide differentiated instruction to build a solid mathematics foundation to reach the needs of each learner.  On-going evaluation of student progress is monitored by conducting pre, benchmark, and post assessments.  Utilize various technology tools including Smart Board, Document Camera, Computer Robots, TI-84â€™s, and various computer software.

              Taught 2 computer science classes with multiple sections. The first class included Introduction to Programming and IB Computer Science I, the second class included AP Computer Science A and Independent Study.  The Introduction to Programming and IB Computer Science I class utilized the Alice, drag and drop programming platform to teach students programming constructs and techniques.  Students developed movies and game programs which were presented at the
              8th grade elective fair.  The AP Computer Science A transitioned students from a drag and drop GUI environment to programming in Java using Eclipse IDE.  Students utilized multiple on-line tools to practice coding and prepare for the AP exam.  </p>
